    <description>
        Spring Cloud Gateway is a library for routing to APIs and providing cross-cutting concerns to them such as:
        security, monitoring/metrics, and resiliency. It allows you to define routes that are matched against the HTTP
        request. The route is defined by a URI, predicates, and filters which are applied to requests.

    <t>
        MapStruct is a code generator that simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a
        convention over configuration approach.
        It generates type-safe bean mappers at compile time, which avoids runtime errors and improves performance
        compared to reflection-based mapping frameworks.
        MapStruct supports various features such as custom methods, nested object mappings, and collection handling.

        Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
        It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries,
        bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting,
        LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability
        via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

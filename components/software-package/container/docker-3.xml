        Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate
        your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly using OS-level virtualization.
        With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking
        advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly
        reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

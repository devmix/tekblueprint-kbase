    <t>
        Podman is a daemonless container management tool that allows you to manage pods, containers, and container images.
        It provides a Docker-compatible command-line interface (CLI) but does not require a daemon to run. Podman supports
        rootless containers, which means it can be used by non-root users without requiring elevated privileges.
